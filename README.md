# Music I made with ChucK

[ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) is an open source audio synthesis framework. It opens a lot of interesting options for music production, and I've been wanting to play with it for a long time. So here I am, learning by doing. This repo is a living work in progress as I get back into music in a way that's somehow even nerdier than Renoise.

You'll need to install ChucK to run these, and some samples may need to be downloaded from their original providers (check for a SOURCE.txt where applicable). Once you have the stuff you need, running `chuck main.ck` in any song directory should play music.
